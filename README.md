# FitnessFantasyI

Hello !

Here is the abstract of our project to give you a rough idea about what we are trying to build.

"To motivate any person who would want to lose weight and do fitness we want to create a videogame-like app where you could gain experience and rewards based on what you eat and how much you exercise. Your progress could then be seen by others such as your friends or the people in your same training area through your profile. Thanks to the rewarding system and the progressionâ€™s overview, the user will keep his motivation to exercise regularly."
